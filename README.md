======================
This is a website for tracking your daily intake of macro-nutrients and calories.  The website assumes you know how to calculate
your TDEE and BRM and know the basics of nutrition.

The idea of this web site came from an excel sheet I created to handle this.  The excel sheet is located in visual_example/Intake.xlsx.
